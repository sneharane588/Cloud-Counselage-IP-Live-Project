# Cloud-Counselage-IP-Live-Project

## <center>PROBLEM STATEMENT
### TECHNOLOGY: DATA SCIENCE</center>

Students from different cities from the state of Maharashtra had applied for the Cloud
Counselage Internship Program. We have the dataset of consisting information of all the
students. Using this data we want to get more insights and draw out more meaningful
conclusions. Interns are expected to build a data visualization model and find the best data
segmentation model using the student’s dataset. Following are the tasks interns need to
perform :<br>
1. Interns need to preprocess the data for missing values, unknown values, encoding
categorical values.
2. Create a data visualization model to build graphs from the dataset answering the
following questions:
a. The number of students applied to different technologies.
b. The number of students applied for Data Science who knew ‘’Python” and
who didn’t.
c. The different ways students learned about this program.
d. Students who are in the fourth year and have a CGPA greater than 8.0.
e. Students who applied for Digital Marketing with verbal and written
communication score greater than 8.
f. Year-wise and area of study wise classification of students.
g. City and college wise classification of students.
h. Plot the relationship between the CGPA and the target variable.
i. Plot the relationship between the Area of Interest and the target variable.
j. Plot the relationship between the year of study, major, and the target variable.
3. Identify the best binary classifier to classify data into “eligible/1” and “not eligible/0”.
